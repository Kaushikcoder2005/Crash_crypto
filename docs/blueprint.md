# **App Name**: Crash Crypto

## Core Features:

- Game Round Simulation: Simulate game rounds that start every 10 seconds.
- USD to Crypto Conversion: Players place bets in USD, which are converted to a chosen cryptocurrency (e.g., BTC or ETH) based on real-time prices. Ensure the price matches the moment of the bet. Use mocks instead of interacting with any real exhanges
- Provably Fair Crash Algorithm: Implement a provably fair crash algorithm to determine the crash point. Make sure the math works and that seeds and hashes work correctly
- Multiplier Display: Display the multiplier, updating it at least every 100ms.
- Potential Earnings Display: Show the potential earnings in USD as the multiplier increases.
- Cashout Handling: Simulate players cashing out and recording winnings or losses
- Real-time event notifications: Show messages about players' activity, and display final cashout results in USD.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated blue (#4285F4) to convey trust and stability, aligning with the crypto theme. The shade is dark enough to provide high contrast on a white background, but also suitable for generating a dark scheme as well.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E8F0FE), a desaturated variant of the primary color to create a calm and focused environment.
- Accent color: Yellow-green (#B7E1CD), an analogous color to the primary, to highlight interactive elements and success states (e.g., cashout confirmation).
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif), for a modern and tech-oriented feel suitable for the app's theme. This font can also be used for limited amounts of body text.
- Use clean, minimalist icons for game controls and status indicators, following a consistent line style.
- A clear, simple layout focused on the multiplier display. Use a contrasting color for the 'Cash Out' button to make it stand out.
- Smooth transitions for multiplier updates and subtle animations for cashout events to provide a visually engaging experience.
